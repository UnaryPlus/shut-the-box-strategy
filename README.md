# Shut the box strategy

A program that computes the optimal strategy for the dice game [shut the box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box) under any scoring method. Although the game is largely chance, there is an element of strategy. For example, the strategy that maximizes the probability of shutting the box shuts the box around 10% of the time, while the strategy that minimizes the odds of shutting the box does so only around 1% of the time.
